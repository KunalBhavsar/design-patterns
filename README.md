 ## Design Patterns
  Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are templates that can be applied to different problems, and they can be used in different programming languages. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.  
  
  We will be covering following types of patterns :
  - [Creational Design Patterns](#creational-design-patterns)
  - [Structural Design Patterns](#structural-design-patterns)
  - [Behavioral Design Patterns](#behavioral-design-patterns)

 ## Creational Design Patterns
  Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation process.
  
  We will be covering following creational patterns :
  - [Builder pattern](./creational/builder_pattern/Readme.md)
  - [Singleton pattern](./creational/singleton_pattern/Readme.md)
  - Prototype pattern
  - Factory method pattern
  - Abstract factory pattern

 ## Structural Design Patterns
  Structural design patterns are design patterns that deal with object composition. They identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same. They make systems more flexible and efficient.
  
  We will be covering following structural patterns :
  - Adapter pattern
  - Bridge pattern
  - Composite pattern
  - Decorator pattern
  - Facade pattern
  - Flyweight pattern
  - Proxy pattern

 ## Behavioral Design Patterns
  Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that deal with object interaction. They describe how objects interact in a distributed manner. They help in identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. They increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
  
  We will be covering following behavioral patterns :
  - Chain of responsibility pattern
  - Command pattern
  - Interpreter pattern
  - Iterator pattern
  - Mediator pattern
  - Memento pattern
  - Observer pattern
  - State pattern
  - Strategy pattern
  - Template method pattern
  - Visitor pattern
